/**
 * Represents an action called 'IGNORE'.
 *
 * This action is used to ignore the user in a conversation. It should be used when the user is aggressive, creepy, or when the conversation has naturally ended.
 * Avoid using this action if the user has engaged directly or if there is a need to communicate with them. Use IGNORE only when the user should be ignored.
 *
 * The action includes a validation function that always returns true and a handler function that also returns true.
 *
 * Examples of using the IGNORE action are provided in the 'examples' array. Each example includes messages between two parties and the use of the IGNORE action.
