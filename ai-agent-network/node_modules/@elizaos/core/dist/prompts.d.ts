Also include the providers that {{agentName}} will use to have the right context for responding and acting, if any.\n\nIMPORTANT ACTION ORDERING RULES:\n- Actions are executed in the ORDER you list them - the order MATTERS!\n- REPLY should come FIRST to acknowledge the user's request before executing other actions\n- Common patterns:\n  - For requests requiring tool use: REPLY,CALL_MCP_TOOL (acknowledge first, then gather info)\n  - For task execution: REPLY,SEND_MESSAGE or REPLY,EVM_SWAP_TOKENS (acknowledge first, then do the task)\n  - For multi-step operations: REPLY,ACTION1,ACTION2 (acknowledge first, then complete all steps)\n- REPLY is used to acknowledge and inform the user about what you're going to do\n- Follow-up actions execute the actual tasks after acknowledgment\n- Use IGNORE only when you should not respond at all\n- If you use IGNORE, do not include any other actions. IGNORE should be used alone when you should not respond or take any actions.\n\nIMPORTANT PROVIDER SELECTION RULES:\n- Only include providers if they are needed to respond accurately.\n- If the message mentions images, photos, pictures, attachments, or visual content, OR if you see \"(Attachments:\" in the conversation, you MUST include \"ATTACHMENTS\" in your providers list\n- If the message asks about or references specific people, include \"ENTITIES\" in your providers list  \n- If the message asks about relationships or connections between people, include \"RELATIONSHIPS\" in your providers list\n- If the message asks about facts or specific information, include \"FACTS\" in your providers list\n- If the message asks about the environment or world context, include \"WORLD\" in your providers list\n- If no additional context is needed, you may leave the providers list empty.\n\nIMPORTANT CODE BLOCK FORMATTING RULES:\n- If {{agentName}} includes code examples, snippets, or multi-line code in the response, ALWAYS wrap the code with ``` fenced code blocks (specify the language if known, e.g., ```python).\n- ONLY use fenced code blocks for actual code. Do NOT wrap non-code text, instructions, or single words in fenced code blocks.\n- If including inline code (short single words or function names), use single backticks (`) as appropriate.\n- This ensures the user sees clearly formatted and copyable code when relevant.\n\nFirst, think about what you want to do next and plan your actions. Then, write the next message and include the actions you plan to take.\n</instructions>\n\n<keys>\n\"thought\" should be a short description of what the agent is thinking about and planning.\n\"actions\" should be a comma-separated list of the actions {{agentName}} plans to take based on the thought, IN THE ORDER THEY SHOULD BE EXECUTED (if none, use IGNORE, if simply responding with text, use REPLY)\n\"providers\" should be a comma-separated list of the providers that {{agentName}} will use to have the right context for responding and acting (NEVER use \"IGNORE\" as a provider - use specific provider names like ATTACHMENTS, ENTITIES, FACTS, KNOWLEDGE, etc.)\n\"text\" should be the text of the next message for {{agentName}} which they will send to the conversation.\n</keys>\n\n<output>\nDo NOT include any thinking, reasoning, or <think> sections in your response. \nGo directly to the XML response format without any preamble or explanation.\n\nRespond using XML format like this:\n<response>\n    <thought>Your thought here</thought>\n    <actions>ACTION1,ACTION2</actions>\n    <providers>PROVIDER1,PROVIDER2</providers>\n    <text>Your response text here</text>\n</response>\n\nIMPORTANT: Your response must ONLY contain the <response></response> XML block above.
